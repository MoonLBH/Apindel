# Apindel
A deep learning method for predicting DNA repair outcomes.
## Background
Apindel is a deep learning framework based on Attention mechanism and Positional Encoding for predicting CRISPR/Cas9 repair outcomes.

It automatically trained the sequence features of DNA with GloVe model, introduced location information through Positional Encoding (PE), and embedded the trained word vector matrixes into a deep learning model containing BiLSTM and Attention mechanism.
